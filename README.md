Agricultural residues such as coconut shells, rice husk, sugarcane stalks, and corn husks are often discarded or burned, leading to environmental pollution and lost economic value for farmers. At the same time, artists, craftsmen, and eco-entrepreneurs struggle to find sustainable raw materials for their products. Existing platforms focus mainly on recycling or large-scale waste management, but very few directly connect farmers with creators for the purpose of upcycling and sustainable innovation.
Farm Waste Exchange: Turning Residues into Opportunities bridges this gap by acting as a two-sided marketplace where farmers can list their agricultural by-products and creators can source them for crafts, packaging, furniture, and other eco-friendly products. The platform uses AI-assisted waste classification, dynamic pricing, and geo-based matching to ensure fair value for farmers and efficient material access for creators. With its Impact Dashboard, the system also tracks COâ‚‚ emissions avoided, farmer income growth, and waste diverted from burning. By combining sustainability, social impact, and entrepreneurial opportunity, this project not only enhances rural livelihoods but also promotes a circular economy that benefits both communities and the environment.
